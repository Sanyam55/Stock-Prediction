• Developed a supervised learning classification model to predict the trend of GME (GameStop Corp.) EOD share price using subreddit WallStreetBets posts’ data such as sentiment analysis
• Designed many ML and deep learning models (such as RandomForest, Gradient boosting, KNN, Logistic regression, and Bayesian neural networks) and checked accuracy of all the models 
• Concluded that we would benefit from using WSB data when predicting stock trend for 2-4 days after the day in question
